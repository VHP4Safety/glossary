# VHP4Safety Glossary

Welcome to the VHP4Safety Glossary!  

The Virtual Human Platform for Safety Assessment (VHP4Safety) is a project to support chemical and pharmaceutical safety testing without using laboratory animals and animal testing, and funded by the Netherlands Research Council (NWO). For more information on the funding, please see [the Funding section](https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#funding) at the end this page.

On this page, you can find (a set of) the terminology and their definitions in the context the terms are used in the project. The terms are categorized below based on the context that the term is used, such as risk assessment, chemicals, or computer infrastructure. In addition, the abbreviations, references, and some supplementary information depending on the category that the term belongs to are presented below.

### Development Version and Contribution

This glossary has been under development since 2022 and is still continuously developed. This means that new terms can be added in the future depending on their prevalence and frequency of use among the project members. In addition, unfortunately, not all the terms and their definitions currently meet the community standards[<sup>1</sup>](https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#references), although our goal is to achieve this status.

This glossary is developedt as [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/glossary). The readers and users of the platform are welcome to contribute. To make new entry queries, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/glossary/issues/new/choose)
