VHP0000025	Adverse Outcome	AO	A specialised type of key event that is generally accepted as being of regulatory significance on the basis of correspondence to an established protection goal or equivalence to an apical endpoint in an accepted regulatory guideline toxicity test.	https://doi.org/10.1787/5jlv1m9d1g32-en
VHP0000023	Adverse Outcome Pathway	AOP	An AOP describes a sequence of events commencing with initial interaction(s) of a stressor with a biomolecule within an organism that causes a perturbation in its biology (i.e., molecular initiating event, MIE), which can progress through a dependent series of intermediate key events (KEs) and culminate in an adverse outcome (AO) considered relevant to risk assessment or regulatory decision-making.	https://doi.org/10.1787/5jlv1m9d1g32-en
VHP0000089	Bioactivity		The affinity and/or potency of a compound for a protein target.	
VHP0000026	Key Event	KE	A change in biological or physiological state that is both measurable and essential to the progression of a defined biological perturbation leading to a specific adverse outcome.	https://doi.org/10.1787/5jlv1m9d1g32-en
VHP0000027	Key Event Relationship	KER	A scientifically-based relationship that connects one key event to another, defines a causal and predictive relationship between the upstream and downstream event, and thereby facilitates inference or extrapolation of the state of the downstream key event from the known, measured, or predicted state of the upstream key event.	https://doi.org/10.1787/5jlv1m9d1g32-en
VHP0000029	Molecular Adverse Outcome Pathways	mAOP	Metapathway, similar to conventional AOPs, but connected events as e.g. WikiPathways pathways. Their function is to expand KEs with molecular pathways and allow analyses of omics data.	
VHP0000024	Molecular Initiating Event	MIE	A specialised type of key event that represents the initial point of chemical/stressor interaction at the molecular level within the organism that results in a perturbation that starts the AOP.	https://doi.org/10.1787/5jlv1m9d1g32-en
VHP0000031	Quantitative Adverse Outcome Pathway	qAOP	"Quantitative AOPs, ""Leiden approach"" to connect events using differential equations."	
VHP0000028	Stressor			
VHP0000030	TXG-MAPr R package	TXG-MAPr	Statistical quantitative AOP approach using known coexpression changes in tissue toxicity.
