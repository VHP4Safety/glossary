VHP0000158	Adverse Outcome (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000025'>adverse outcome</a>, although specifically refers to clinical and epidemiological effects. It categorizes services that provide information on the toxicological endpoints and adverse outcomes at a clinical or epidemiological level of chemical exposures.	
VHP0000016	Apical Endpoint			
VHP0000019	European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods	ECVAM	The EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing, located in Ispra, Italy.	
VHP0000020	European Chemical Agency	ECHA	An agency of the European Union which manages the technical and administrative aspects of the implementation of the European Union regulation called Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals.	https://echa.europa.eu/
VHP0000021	European Food Safety Authority	EFSA	Legislator	
VHP0000147	Exposure		Contact between a toxicological agent and an outer boundary of an organism. 	
VHP0000104	Exposure Assessment		The process of assessing the magnitude, frequency and duration of exposure of a certain organism to a certain agent; OF the process of assessing the total external (or internal) exposure following one or more exposure/use scenarios that are described in terms of route, extent, frequency and duration of exposure, including exposure via more than one exposure route (aggregated exposure) and exposure to multiple chemicals (cumulative exposure).	
VHP0000154	(External) Exposure (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000104'>exposure assessment</a> and categorizes services that evaluate and analyze the route, duration, magnitude and frequency of exposure of an organism or (sub)population to one or multiple chemicals.	
VHP0000102	Hazard Assessment		The process of assessing the intrinsic hazard a substance poses to human health and/or the environment. This provides information on potential human health effects such that a safe production and use of a chemical can be assured. Two types can be generally distinguished, i.e. with the purpose to classify the chemical to a certain category of toxicity (mostly qualitative assessment) or to derive an exposure limit, such as a health-based guidance value or product limit, that ensures safe use.	
VHP0000153	Hazard/Chemical Characteristics (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000102'>hazard assessment</a> and considered to be cheminformatics-based. It categorizes services that use molecular structures, chemical descriptors, and databases to predict or analyze the properties, behavior, and potential risks of chemical substances.	
VHP0000017	Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment	IATA		
VHP0000157	Internal (Exposure) 		The amount of a chemical (or its active metabolites) present in human tissues or biological fluids over time, typically expressed as concentration-time profiles or dose metrics, resulting from external exposure after ADME/TK processes, and used as the input for the Toxicodynamics/AOP step.	
VHP0000018	Mode of Action	MoA	A functional or anatomical change, resulting from the exposure of a living organism to a substance.	
VHP0000022	The legislation of 'Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals'	REACH	Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).	http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2006/1907/2022-05-01
VHP0000101	Risk Assessment		The process of assessing human health risks in a historic, current or emerging exposure scenario for which a concern has risen.	
VHP0000103	Safety Assessment		The overarching term for hazard and risk assessment in toxicology. For pharmaceuticals, this term is generally used for assessments of the safety of a certain application of pharmaceuticals, including the determination of the therapeutic window and risk/benefit analysis.	
VHP0000156	Toxicodynamics/AOP (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after Toxicodynamics and categorizes services that use or extend the (quantitative) AOP framework to analyze and assess the interaction of chemicals with biological targets.	
VHP0000155	Toxicokinetics/ADME (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000058'>toxicokinetics</a> and categorizes services that analyze the kinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of chemicals and how these processes influence the internal dose. The kinetics step contains four physiological processes substeps: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion which can be captured in PBK models.
