VHP0000019	European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods	ECVAM	The EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing, located in Ispra, Italy.	
VHP0000020	European Chemical Agency	ECHA	An agency of the European Union which manages the technical and administrative aspects of the implementation of the European Union regulation called Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals.	https://echa.europa.eu/
VHP0000021	European Food Safety Authority	EFSA	Legislator	
VHP0000147	Exposure		Contact between a toxicological agent and an outer boundary of an organism. 	
VHP0000104	Exposure Assessment		The process of assessing the magnitude, frequency and duration of exposure of a certain organism to a certain agent; OF the process of assessing the total external (or internal) exposure following one or more exposure/use scenarios that are described in terms of route, extent, frequency and duration of exposure, including exposure via more than one exposure route (aggregated exposure) and exposure to multiple chemicals (cumulative exposure).	
VHP0000102	Hazard Assessment		The process of assessing the intrinsic hazard a substance poses to human health and/or the environment. This provides information on potential human health effects such that a safe production and use of a chemical can be assured. Two types can be generally distinguished, i.e. with the purpose to classify the chemical to a certain category of toxicity (mostly qualitative assessment) or to derive an exposure limit, such as a health-based guidance value or product limit, that ensures safe use.	
VHP0000017	Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment	IATA		
VHP0000018	Mode of Action	MoA	A functional or anatomical change, resulting from the exposure of a living organism to a substance.	
VHP0000022	The legislation of 'Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals'	REACH	Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).	http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2006/1907/2022-05-01
VHP0000101	Risk Assessment		The process of assessing human health risks in a historic, current or emerging exposure scenario for which a concern has risen.	
VHP0000103	Safety Assessment		The overarching term for hazard and risk assessment in toxicology. For pharmaceuticals, this term is generally used for assessments of the safety of a certain application of pharmaceuticals, including the determination of the therapeutic window and risk/benefit analysis.
