VHP0000001	3 Rs Principle	3Rs	Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement. Used in the context of performing more humane animal research.	
VHP0000002	Benchmark dose	BMD	See Benchmark dose modeling	
VHP0000003	Benchmark dose modeling	BMD	An approach to determine the toxicological limit values for human health, such as the acceptable daily intake (ADI), of all chemical substances (e.g., food) regardless of type or origin. BMD modeling (possibly in combination with PBK modeling) analyzes in conjunction with multiple test systems and organ systems, to study how exposure variation has on the outcome of anin vitrotest system.	
VHP0000132	Blood Brain Barrier	BBB	A tissue to protect the brain and spinal cord from both toxic and pathogenic agents in the blood. It is formed by extensive tight junctions between vascular epithelial cells, which are polarized into luminal (blood-facing) and abluminal (brain-facing) plasma membrane domains.	
VHP0000004	Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology	DART		
VHP0000005	Developmental Neurotoxicity	DNT		
VHP0000006	(human) Embryonic Stem Cell	(h)ESCs	Pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst (an early-stage pre-implantation embryo). These cells are characterised by their ability to differentiate into any cell type of the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. They are also known for their self-renewal capability, meaning they can proliferate indefinitely in culture while maintaining their pluripotency.	
VHP0000108	induced Embryonic Stem Cell	iPSCs	A type of pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from adult cells. The process of creating iPSCs involves reprogramming differentiated somatic cells (such as skin or blood cells) by introducing specific genes that reset the cells to a pluripotent state. This reprogramming allows iPSCs to develop into almost any cell type in the body, similarly to hESCs, making them highly valuable for regenerative medicine, disease modelling, and drug discovery.	
VHP0000007	Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level	LOAEL	The lowest exposure level of a chemical stressor evaluated in a toxicity test that shows harmful effects on a plant or animal.	
VHP0000008	Monte Carlo Risk Assessment	MCRA	See Monte Carlo Risk Assessment calculation model.	
VHP0000009	Monte Carlo Risk Assessment calculation model		A modeling technique for realistically possible calculation of the intake of risk substances by humans, for example via food, where the exposure can also be linked to the hazard, with which a risk assessment can be carried out.	
VHP0000010	New Approach Methodology	NAM	A collection of various methods (e.g., high-throughput screening and high-content methods) in a wide set of contexts includingin chemicoandin vitroto improve knowledge over the toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic attributes of chemical substances, and in turn to improve the chemical safety assessment (see also Non-Animal Methodology).	https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/22816069/scientific_ws_proceedings_en.pdf/a2087434-0407-4705-9057-95d9c2c2cc57,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2022.105261
VHP0000110	Non-Animal Methodology		A collection of methods to evaluate the potential for a chemical to cause systematic toxicity without using tests on animals (see also New Approach Methodology).	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-014-1421-5
VHP0000011	High Throughput Screening	HTS		
VHP0000012	No Observed Adverse Effect Level	NOAEL	The highest exposure level of a chemical stressor evaluated in a toxicity test that shows no harmful effects on a plant or animal.	
VHP0000143	pCHEMBL		A value that allows a number of roughly comparable measures of half-maximal response concentration/potency/affinity to be compared on a negative logarithmic scale.	https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/frequently-asked-questions/chembl-data-questions#what-is-pchembl
VHP0000013	Read accross		A common approach in the risk assessment in order to examine structural similarities between the source and the target substances when there is a lack of information on their physical-chemical, toxicological properties, or environmental fate.	
VHP0000014	Teratology		Scientific field that studies the causes, mechanisms, and classes of congenital malformations in animals and plants.	https://www.britannica.com/science/teratology
VHP0000015	No Observed Effect Level	NOEL 	The highest exposure level of a chemical stressor evaluated in a toxicity test that shows no effects on a plant or animal. 	
VHP0000056	Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion	ADME	Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a substance (toxic or not) in a living organism, following exposure to this substance
