VHP0000158	Adverse Outcome (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000025'>adverse outcome</a>, although specifically refers to clinical and epidemiological effects. It categorizes services that provide information on the toxicological endpoints and adverse outcomes at a clinical or epidemiological level of chemical exposures.	https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000025	
VHP0000150	Case Study		A human-health scenario used as a guiding use case within the VHP4Safety Project to integrate data, models, and tools, and to formulate specific regulatory questions that the Virtual Human Platform should be able to answer.		
VHP0000154	(External) Exposure (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000104'>exposure assessment</a> and categorizes services that evaluate and analyze the route, duration, magnitude and frequency of exposure of an organism or (sub)population to one or multiple chemicals.	https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000104	
VHP0000153	Hazard/Chemical Characteristics (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000102'>hazard assessment</a> and considered to be cheminformatics-based. It categorizes services that use molecular structures, chemical descriptors, and databases to predict or analyze the properties, behavior, and potential risks of chemical substances.	https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000102	
VHP0000152	Process Flow Step		One of the generic stages in the VHP4Safety human-based risk-assessment workflow, used to structure tools, data and models along the risk assessment process.	 	
VHP0000151	Regulatory Question	RQ 	A concrete, decision-oriented risk-assessment question, formulated for a given case study, that the Virtual Human Platform should help to answer step-by-step.		
VHP0000156	Toxicodynamics/AOP (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after Toxicodynamics and categorizes services that use or extend the (quantitative) AOP framework to analyze and assess the interaction of chemicals with biological targets.	https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000102	
VHP0000155	Toxicokinetics/ADME (<i>Process Flow Step</i>)		A process flow step that is named after <a href='https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000058'>toxicokinetics</a> and categorizes services that analyze the kinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of chemicals and how these processes influence the internal dose. The kinetics step contains four physiological processes substeps: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion which can be captured in PBK models.	https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/#VHP0000102
